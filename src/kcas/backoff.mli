(** Randomized exponential backoff mechanism. *)

type t
(** Type of backoff values. *)

val max_wait_log : int
(** Logarithm of the maximum allowed value for wait. *)

val create : ?lower_wait_log:int -> ?upper_wait_log:int -> unit -> t
(** [create] creates a backoff value.  [upper_wait_log], [lower_wait_log]
    override the logarithmic upper and lower bound on the number of spins
    executed by {!once}. *)

val default : t
(** [default] is equivalent to [create ()]. *)

val once : t -> t
(** [once b] executes one random wait and returns a new backoff with logarithm
    of the current maximum value incremented unless it is already at
    [upper_wait_log] of [b].

    Note that this uses the default Stdlib [Random] per-domain generator. *)

val reset : t -> t
(** [reset b] returns a backoff equivalent to [b] except with current value set
    to the [lower_wait_log] of [b]. *)

val get_wait_log : t -> int
(** [get_wait_log b] returns logarithm of the maximum value of wait for next
    {!once}. *)
