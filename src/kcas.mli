(** {1 Manipulating multiple locations atomically}

    Multiple shared memory locations can be manipulated atomically using either

    - {!Op}, to specify a list of primitive operations to perform,
    - {!Tx}, to specify a composable transaction, or
    - {!Xt}, to explicitly pass a transaction log to record accesses.

    Atomic operations over multiple shared memory locations are performed in two
    or three phases:

    1. The first phase essentially records a list or log of operations to access
    shared memory locations.

    2. The second phase attempts to perform the operations atomically.

    3. In {!Mode.obstruction_free} a third phase verifies all read-only
    operations.

    Each phase may fail.  In particular, in the first phase, as no changes to
    shared memory have yet been attempted, it is safe, for example, to raise
    exceptions to signal failure.  Failure on the third phase raises
    {!Mode.Interference}. *)

      for [atomically] is {!Mode.lock_free}.

      The algorithm requires provided operations to follow a global total order.
      To eliminate a class of bugs, the operations are sorted automatically.  If
      the operations are given in either ascending or descending order of the
      targeted shared memory location ids, then sorting is done in linear time
      [O(n)] and does not increase the time complexity of the algorithm.
      Otherwise sorting may take linearithmic time [O(n*log(n))]. *)
end

(** {2 Composable transactions on multiple locations}

    The {!Tx} and {!Xt} modules provide two different ways to implement
    composable transactions over shared memory locations.  Using either of those
    one essentially declares a transaction that specifies how to access shared
    memory locations.  To actually perform the accesses one then separately
    commits the transaction.

    Accesses of shared memory locations inside either form of transaction should
    generally use the access operations, such as {!Tx.get} and {!Xt.get},
    provided by the corresponding module.  Transactions should also generally
    not perform arbitrary side-effects, because when a transaction is committed
    it may be attempted multiple times meaning that the side-effects are also
    performed multiple times.

    {b WARNING}: Operations provided by the {!Loc} module for accessing
    individual shared memory locations are not transactional.  There are cases
    where it can be advantageous to perform operations along with a transaction
    that do not get recorded into the transaction log, but doing so requires one
    to reason about the potential parallel interleavings of operations. *)

(** Transactions on shared memory locations. *)
module Tx : sig
  type +'a t
  (** Type of transactions on shared memory locations.

      A transaction can be thought of as a specification of a sequence of {!get}
      and {!set} accesses to shared memory locations that can be {!attempt}ed to
      perform the accesses atomically.

      Transactions can be composed both sequentially (see {!let*}) and
      conditionally (see {!(<|>)} and {!forget}).

      Here is an example of unconditionally {!commit}ting a transaction that
      swaps the values of the two shared memory locations [x_loc] and [y_loc]
      and returns their sum:

      {[
        commit begin
          let* x = get x_loc
          and* y = get y_loc in
          let+ () = set y_loc x
          and+ () = set x_loc y in
          x + y
        end
      ]}

      Above, [get y_loc] and [set y_loc x] are intentionally one after the
      other, because the internal log used within transactions to record {!get}s
      and {!set}s is optimized for accessing recently accessed elements again.

      Here is an example of {!attempt}ing a conditional transaction

      {[
        attempt begin
          begin
            let* x = get x_loc in
            if x < 0 then
              forget
            else
              return x
          end
          <|> get y_loc
        end
      ]}

      that reads [x_loc], but {!forget}s the access in case [x_loc] had a
      negative value and then reads [y_loc] instead.

      What does that actually mean?  Let's assume [x_loc] initially contains a
      negative value.  During the first phase of the transaction [x_loc] is read
      and is found to be negative.  The access is forgotten.  Let's assume that
      after that the value of [x_loc] is modified by some other domain.  The
      transaction continues to read [y_loc] and results in the value of [y_loc].
      The transaction is allowed to commit despite the value of [x_loc] having
      been changed during the transaction.

      Consider the following similar looking conditional transaction {!attempt}:

      {[
        attempt begin
          let* x = get x_loc in
          if x < 0 then
            get y_loc
          else
            return x
        end
      ]}

      If some other domain modifies [x_loc] after it has been read by the above
      transaction attempt, then the commit phase will fail, because the access
      of [x_loc] is found to be inconsistent.

      Note that neither of the above conditional examples is generally
      preferred, because they have fundamentally different semantics and the
      choice of whether accesses should, should not, or may be safely forgotten
      depends on what the desired semantics are for the transaction. *)
